# Weather app


##
My first project working with APIs! This is a simple weather app with a search feature. It shows the current weather with an emoji and a background that adapts to the weather conditions. “H” indicates the highest temperature today and “L” indicates the lowest. The app also provides an hourly breakdown from the current hour to the end of the day, displaying the temperature and a corresponding emoji for each weather condition.
